# Zodiacs, personality traits, and careers

Sooo, where to begin. First of all, I loved doing this project. From start to finish (while there were definitely challenges along the way), I feel like this has been the most rewarding project I've done. 

I started out brainstorming ideas for the survey I asked basically everyone in my life to participate in. I asked people their birthday, age, profession, and gender, as well as to pick the four personality traits they most identified with. 

# Analysis
I used Pandas to explore and analyze my data. Through comparing the columns of data I received through my survey, I found the data was malleable for the questions I had.

# Story
When I started out the visualizations of the story, I first decided on a color palette. While I mostly chose purple because I love the color, I also wanted to pick a color that I think of when reading stories about zodiacs. I also wanted a fun font that would invite a reader in. There are also no shortage of puns throughout the story to keep the reader interested in the topic. 

# Challenges
For this project, I really wanted to use scrollytelling as my method of presenting the findings. For a first go at scrollytelling, I think I did a pretty good job. Understanding the rules of Javascript and how they correlate with HTML and CSS was the toughest piece of the puzzle.
