      What's your sign? What does your chart tell someone about you? What job are you likely to have based on your
      zodiac sign? These are all questions that are trending on social media. According to the Western zodiac, there are
      12 signs: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces.
      Each have their own personality traits, symbols, compatibilities and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something I've found very interesting is the overlap between personality traits and zodiac signs. For example, I
      am a Cancer. A <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/horoscopes/a27811788/cancer-traits/">top</a> search result
      for Cancers is that we are "loyal to the end." For this project, I wanted to see how people truly see themselves,
      and whether there are any connections between personality traits and zodiac signs.

        <p>I asked people to provide their birthday, gender, age group, to choose the four personality
          traits they most identify with, and to identify their profession for a survey to curate this dataset.

        <p> In this sunburst (no pun intended) graphic, we can see each zodiac sign and the personality trait they most
          closely
          identified with. Three signs: Aries, Cancer, and Leo responded with 'loyal' as their top choice.
          Similarly, three signs: Gemini, Virgo and Scorpio, responded with 'curious' as their top choice.
